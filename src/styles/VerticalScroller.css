/* Note: Individual slide styles are now applied directly in the component's code
via `cloneElement`. This is because each child passed from Plasmic might be a 
different component, and this method ensures the scrolling animation is
applied correctly to whatever you drop in the slot. This CSS file just sets
up the main container.
